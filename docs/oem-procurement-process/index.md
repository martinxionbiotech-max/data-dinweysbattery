faq:
  - q: What are the steps in a truck battery OEM order?
    a: Buyer requirement → technical specification → sample → testing → validation → pre-production → mass production → QC → documentation → shipment. Each step has a defined output and a verification point.
  - q: What does the buyer provide in an OEM order?
    a: The buyer provides the application (vehicle/engine/climate), the target spec (voltage, CCA, Ah, group size, terminal type, polarity), branding/packaging design, and the order quantity and lead-time requirement.
  - q: What does the manufacturer provide?
    a: The manufacturer provides the production capacity and equipment, the quality system (IATF 16949), the raw-material sourcing, per-batch testing and documentation (COA, test reports), and export/packaging support.
  - q: What can go wrong in a battery OEM order?
    a: Spec mismatch (wrong terminal or polarity), sample-to-production drift, insufficient QC documentation, packaging damage in transit, and unclear standards (e.g. a JIS CCA quoted against an EN test). Each failure is cheapest to catch at the sample or specification stage.
  - q: What should I verify before confirming a battery order?
    a: Verify the specification sheet against the sample, confirm the test standard (JIS/EN/SAE) for every CCA figure, check terminal type and polarity against your vehicle, and require per-batch COA and test reports in the contract.
  - q: What is a typical truck battery OEM MOQ and lead time?
    a: A typical OEM MOQ is a 1 × 20 ft container with a 20–45 day lead time. Confirm exact terms with the manufacturer before committing.

# Truck Battery OEM Procurement Process: From Requirement to Shipment

**TL;DR** — A truck battery OEM order is a ten-stage chain from buyer requirement to shipment.
Every stage has a defined output, an owner (buyer or manufacturer), a failure mode, and a
verification point. The cheapest place to catch a mistake is the specification sheet and the
pre-production sample — not the container.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The spec sheet is the contract** — a single ambiguous line (e.g. "800 A" without saying JIS, EN or SAE) can turn a whole container into the wrong product.
2. **Every stage has an owner and a verification point** — buyer and manufacturer each contribute defined inputs; if a stage has no owner, it has no accountability.
3. **The sample is the cheapest risk-control** — a terminal type, polarity or label error caught on the sample costs hours; the same error on a 1 × 20 ft container costs a season.
4. **Documentation is a deliverable, not an afterthought** — per-batch COA, test reports and MSDS are what a distributor needs to re-sell with confidence; require them in the purchase contract.
5. **Standards discipline runs through the whole chain** — a JIS CCA and an EN cold-cranking figure are different tests; the standard must be fixed at the spec stage and never left implicit.

## The Ten-Stage Chain

| Stage | Buyer provides | Manufacturer provides | What can go wrong | Buyer verifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Requirement | Vehicle type, engine, climate, application | Technical guidance on group/standard | Vague requirement (e.g. "a truck battery") | A written requirement doc |
| 2. Specification | Target voltage/CCA/Ah/group/terminal/polarity | Datasheet matching the spec | Ambiguous standard (JIS vs EN vs SAE CCA) | Spec sheet with explicit test standard |
| 3. Sample | Approval criteria | Pre-production sample | Sample ≠ production spec | Sample against spec, in writing |
| 4. Testing | Test conditions (climate, duty) | Test reports (CCA, capacity, leak) | Test method mismatch | Test report with stated standard |
| 5. Validation | Field/bench validation | Engineering support | Uncaught fitment or terminal issue | Fitment + terminal + polarity check |
| 6. Pre-production | Final spec lock | Pilot run | Last-minute spec change | Locked spec sign-off |
| 7. Mass production | Order volume | Production under IATF 16949 | Batch-to-batch drift | In-process QC evidence |
| 8. QC | Acceptance criteria | Per-batch inspection + COA | Insufficient QC documentation | COA + inspection report per batch |
| 9. Documentation | Document requirements (COA/MSDS) | Full export documentation | Missing/incomplete docs | Complete doc pack |
| 10. Shipment | Incoterms, destination | Packaging, container loading | Transit damage | Packaging spec + loading plan |

This table is the whole discipline. Read each row as: *who owns the input, who owns the output,
what breaks, and what the buyer checks before signing off the stage.*

## The Three Highest-Risk Stages (and How to De-Risk Them)

### Stage 2 — Specification: the standards trap

The single most expensive ambiguity in truck battery OEM is an unstated test standard. "800 A"
means three different things:

| Rating | Standard | Test temperature |
|---|---|---|
| 800 A CCA | SAE J537 | −18°C |
| 800 A (EN) | EN 50342-1 | −18°C |
| 800 A CCA | JIS D5301 | −15°C |

A JIS figure is numerically flattered by testing at a warmer temperature. If your spec sheet
says only "800 A cold cranking" without naming the standard, you have no idea what you are
buying. **Fix the standard in writing at the spec stage — never leave it implicit.**

### Stage 3 — Sample: the cheapest correction point

Every spec error caught on the pre-production sample — a terminal type (European T1 vs JIS type
A), a polarity (left vs right positive), a label colour — costs hours to fix. The identical
error caught only after a 1 × 20 ft container lands costs a full production cycle plus
rework and delay. **Approve the sample in writing, against the locked specification sheet.**

### Stage 7–8 — Production and QC: the consistency risk

Batch-to-batch drift is the hidden killer for distributors who re-sell. A manufacturer's first
batch may meet spec perfectly while a later batch drifts on CCA or capacity. De-risk by
requiring **per-batch COA and test reports** in the contract — not a single "sample" report —
so every container you receive has its own verified documentation.

## Documentation You Should Require (and Why)

| Document | What it proves | Why a buyer needs it |
|---|---|---|
| COA (Certificate of Analysis) | Per-batch CCA/Ah/RC measured values | Proves the shipped batch met the spec |
| Test report | Test method + results | Proves the standard used (JIS/EN/SAE) |
| MSDS (Safety Data Sheet) | Chemical/handling safety | Required for transport and import |
| Inspection report | Visual/leak/dimension checks | Proves physical conformance |

These are deliverables, not favours. A distributor cannot re-sell with confidence — or clear
customs — without them. Demand them in the purchase contract.

## Matching This to DINWEYS

DINWEYS's OEM program is run by Chengguang Power Tech Co., Ltd. (founded 2002), a 200,000 m²
