faq:
  - q: What is the difference between CCA and reserve capacity?
    a: CCA (cold cranking amps) measures the short burst of current to start a cold engine. Reserve capacity (RC) measures how long the battery can sustain a 25-amp load before dropping below 10.5V — i.e. endurance, not burst power.
  - q: Which matters more for a truck battery — CCA or RC?
    a: It depends on the duty cycle. Cold-climate long-haul trucks need high CCA (1000–1100+). Trucks with sleeper cabs, liftgates, GPS and anti-idling operation need high RC (220–320 min). Modern fleets increasingly prioritise RC because of on-board "hotel loads".
  - q: Why are fleets shifting from CCA to RC?
    a: Anti-idling laws and more on-board electronics mean trucks now power "hotel loads" (sleeper HVAC, inverters, telematics) with the engine off. High CCA does not help there — only reserve capacity (minutes at 25 A) and Ah do.h do.
  - q: Can a battery have high CCA but low RC?
    a: Yes. A starting-optimised battery can deliver a large burst (high CCA) but drain quickly (low RC). Deep-cycling such a battery to ~50% causes sulfation and premature failure.
  - q: How do I choose between a high-CCA and high-RC battery?
    a: Match to your duty: cold starts and short runs → prioritize CCA; sleeper cabs, liftgates, frequent engine-off loads → prioritize RC/Ah. The DINWEYS range below shows both side by side (e.g. 145G51: 900 A CCA, 220 min RC).

# CCA vs Reserve Capacity: A Dual-Metric Guide for Fleets

**TL;DR** — CCA is burst power for cold starts; reserve capacity (RC) is endurance for
engine-off loads. Most buyers fixate on CCA and under-buy RC — but modern trucks with sleeper
cabs, liftgates and anti-idling electronics increasingly live and die by reserve capacity.
Here is a dual-metric profile of the DINWEYS range so you can match the battery to the duty.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CCA and RC measure different physics** — CCA is a burst at −18°C, RC is endurance in minutes at 25A; a battery strong at one can be weak at the other.
2. **High CCA can silently mean low RC** — the 58827 pairs 800 A EN with only 150 minutes RC, and deep-cycling such a battery causes sulfation and premature failure.
3. **The JIS range carries the deepest reserve** — 220–320 minutes across the N-series beats the DIN models' 150–170 minutes, which is why thick-plate JIS dominates heavy commercial duty.
4. **For engine-off loads, minutes beat amps** — the 190H52's 320 minutes matters more than its 1100 A once anti-idling laws force sleeper HVAC and telematics onto the battery.
5. **Duty cycle, not preference, picks the metric** — liftgates sometimes cycle 30+ times a day, so a delivery truck needs RC/Ah and cycle life first, while a cold-climate short-run truck still wants the highest CCA (1000–1100+) in its group.

## The Two Metrics, Side by Side

| Metric | What it measures | Unit | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| CCA | Cold-start burst power | Amps (−18°C/−15°C) | Starting a cold diesel engine |
| RC | Sustained load endurance | Minutes at 25A | Running "hotel loads" engine-off |
| Ah | Total energy storage | Amp-hours | Overall runtime and deep-cycling |

CCA and RC measure different things: **power (burst)** versus **energy (endurance)**. A battery
can be strong at one and weak at the other.

The ratio of the two is the tell: the DIN 58827 pairs 800 A EN with 150 minutes RC — about 5.3 A
of cranking power per reserve minute — while the JIS 190H52 pairs 1100 A with 320 minutes, only
about 3.4 A per minute. The JIS battery is biased toward endurance, the DIN unit toward burst. Two
batteries can both be called "heavy-duty" yet be optimized for opposite jobs, which is why matching
battery to duty cycle — not to a single headline number — is what actually prevents roadside failures.

## Why Fleets Are Shifting from CCA to RC

Ten years ago, the question was "how high is the CCA?" Today, anti-idling regulations and denser
on-board electronics have changed the game. When the engine is off, the battery must power:

- Sleeper-cab HVAC and inverters
- Telematics and GPS
- Liftgates (sometimes dozens of cycles a day)
- Refrigeration and lift equipment

These are **"hotel loads"** — they draw sustained current, not a burst. A battery with high CCA
but low RC will be deep-cycled into early sulfation failure. This is the single most overlooked
failure mode in modern fleets.

## The DINWEYS Dual-Metric Profile

Using the published specifications of the DINWEYS heavy-duty range, here is each model's CCA and
reserve-capacity picture together:

| Model | Standard | CCA | Reserve capacity | Best fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 190H52 (N200) | JIS | 1100 A | 320 min | Cold-start + heavy hotel loads |
| 145G51 (N150) | JIS | 900 A | 220 min | Balanced long-haul |
| 60038 (DIN100) | DIN/EN | 870 A EN | 170 min | European truck, moderate loads |
| 58827 (DIN88) | DIN/EN | 800 A EN | 150 min | European light truck |

!!! note "A note on the JIS advantage"
    JIS thick-plate (Pb-Sb) batteries deliver not only strong CCA but also the deepest reserve
    capacity in the range — 220–320 minutes. That dual strength is why the N-series is the
    default choice for heavy commercial duty across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

## How to Match Battery to Duty Cycle

| Duty cycle | Dominant need | Prioritize |
|---|---|---|
| Cold-climate, short runs | Cold start | CCA |
| Long-haul, cold winters | Cold start | CCA (highest in group) |
| Sleeper cab, anti-idling | Hotel loads | RC / Ah |
| Delivery with liftgate | Frequent deep cycle | RC / Ah + cycle life |
| Refrigerated / cold chain | Sustained load | Ah + deep-cycle |

## The Takeaway

Stop buying on CCA alone. Identify what your trucks actually do with the engine off, then
specify the battery whose reserve capacity and capacity match that load. For most modern
sleeper-cab and delivery fleets, that means paying at least as much attention to **RC and Ah**
as to CCA.
